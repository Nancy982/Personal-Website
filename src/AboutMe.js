            Hi, I'm Nancy Medina, an IT professional with 4 years of experience and a strong passion for software development. I thrive in collaborative environments and love working with others to solve problems. When I'm not immersed in tech, you can find me walking, working out, or indulging in my love for pastel pink, decor, and creating aesthetically pleasing office setups. Welcome to my portfolio!
